# First-Website-Using-React
CURRENTLY BUGGED DUE TO A BOOTSTRAP ERROR(i suspect, not exactly knowable) AND NOT OPERATIONAL. It was my first attempt at making a login and registration without the use of third party company like Mailchimp. The front-end still works on local but actual full-stack functionality is out of the discussion that is wayyyyy beyond me. Im only one person ;(
